# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This changelog mostly follows the conventions of
[Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/); it deviates from those
conventions by not making versions and sections linkable.

This project uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
In addition, breaking changes between successive
initial development versions (that is 0.y.z versions)
are explicitly noted.
